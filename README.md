# EM Project – Gaussian Mixture Models

> **Date:** 🟢 **november 4th, 2025**

---

## 📖 General Description

This project implements the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm** for **multivariate Gaussian mixture models**. The implementation supports both **hard assignment** (where each data point is fully assigned to a single Gaussian) and **soft assignment** (where points have probabilistic membership across multiple Gaussians).

The goal is to provide a **comprehensive understanding** of how the EM algorithm works with multivariate distributions, including parameter estimation, cluster assignment, and convergence behavior.

## 🚀 What the Program Does

### Core Functionality
- **Generates synthetic data** from multiple multivariate Gaussian distributions with customizable parameters
- **Implements the complete EM algorithm** for Gaussian mixture models:
  - **E-step**: Computes responsibilities (probabilistic cluster assignments)
  - **M-step**: Updates means, covariance matrices, and mixture weights
- **Automatically estimates** the parameters of the underlying Gaussian distributions
- **Assigns points to clusters** based on maximum likelihood
